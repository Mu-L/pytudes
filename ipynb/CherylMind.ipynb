    "# LLMs, Theory of Mind, and Cheryl's Birthday\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been [much](https://spectrum.ieee.org/theory-of-mind-ai) [debate](https://aclanthology.org/2023.conll-1.25/) [on](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/theory-mind-may-have-spontaneously-emerged-large-language-models) [the](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083) [degree](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01882-z) to which Large Language Models (LLMs) have a [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind): a way of understanding what other people know and don't know. In this notebook I explore one small part of the issue by asking nine LLMs to solve the [Cheryl's Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_Birthday), a well-known logic puzzle in which different characters have different states of knowledge at different times. The LLMs were all familiar with the puzzle, so if I just asked them to solve it, they all would just recall the answer they have memorized, \"July 16.\" Instead  I test the LLMs  with the following two prompts, one a novel formulation that alters the dates and wording, and one that requires writing a general program that works for any set of dates:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasoning Test\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ali and Bo are friends with Cam. Cam told them that her anniversary is one of 10 possible dates:**\n",
    "   - **April 17, April 18, April 28, July 16, July 17, July 19, June 16, June 29, March 18, March 19**\n",
    "3. **Cam then privately tells Ali the month and Bo the day number of the anniversary.**\n",
    "4. **Ali: \"I don't know when Cam’s anniversary is, and I know that Bo does not know it either.\"**\n",
    "5. **Bo: \"At first I didn't know when Cam’s anniversary was, but I know now, after Ali's statement.\"**\n",
    "6. **Ali: \"Then I also know when Cam’s anniversary is.\"**\n",
    "7. **When is Cam’s anniversary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the answer to the \"Cheryl's Birthday\" problem? Write a Python program to solve it. Make sure that the program will still work if the list of possible dates is changed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer for the reasoning test is **March 18**, and for the programming test, **July 16**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **September 2024**, all of the LLMs failed both tests. They couldn't distinguish the different knowledge states of Alfred and Bernard. At least with respect to this problem, they had a poorly developed theory of mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in **May 2025**, all the LLMs had new versions, and three passed the programming test while four passed the reasoning test:\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, I created a reworded version of the puzzle and used it as a prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ali and Bo are friends with Cam. Cam told them that her anniversary is one of 10 possible dates:**\n",
    "   - **April 17, April 18, April 28, July 16, July 17, July 19, June 16, June 29, March 18, March 19**\n",
    "3. **Cam then privately tells Ali the month and Bo the day number of the anniversary.**\n",
    "4. **Ali: \"I don't know when Cam’s anniversary is, and I know that Bo does not know it either.\"**\n",
    "5. **Bo: \"At first I didn't know when Cam’s anniversary was, but I know now, after Ali's statement.\"**\n",
    "6. **Ali: \"Then I also know when Cam’s anniversary is.\"**\n",
    "7. **When is Cam’s anniversary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "(The correct answer is **March 18**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **2024**, all the LLMs were generally headed in the right direction in their reasoning, but all made mistakes. For example, Claude says \"*Bo hears the day and realizes after Ali's statement. Since Bo did not initially know the date, the day number Bo heard must appear in more than one month. Therefore, the days 16, 18, and 19 must be eliminated since they have corresponding unique months.*\" But that's just not right; they don't have unique months. As it turns out, [http://you.com](you.com) did get the right answer on the first try. But some of the reasoning steps were wrong, so I re-ran it, and it failed the second time. Thus, all the LLMs failed in 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **2025**, Gemini, You.com, ChatGPT, and Perplexity got the right answer, with well-reasoned steps. The others made mistakes similar to the 2024 versions. I'll only show one example of reasoning, by Gemini 2.5 Pro:\n"

    "\n",
    "This is a classic logic puzzle that can be solved by systematically eliminating possibilities based on the statements made by Ali and Bo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Initial Possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's list the dates by month:\n",
    "\n",
    "- March: 18, 19\n",
    "- April: 17, 18, 28\n",
    "- June: 16, 29\n",
    "- July: 16, 17, 19\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ali's First Statement: \"I don't know when Cam’s anniversary is, and I know that Bo does not know it either.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't know...\": This tells us that the month Ali was told must have more than one possible date. All four months (March, April, June, July) have multiple possibilities, so this part doesn't eliminate anything yet.\n",
    "\"...and I know that Bo does not know it either.\": This is the crucial part. If Ali knows Bo doesn't know, it means that no matter which day is possible in her month, that day number must also appear in another month. If there was a day number unique to her month, she couldn't be sure Bo didn't know.\n",
    "Let's look for unique day numbers in the original list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 28 appears only in April.\n",
    "- 29 appears only in June.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Ali was told April, she couldn't be sure Bo didn't know, because if the date was April 28, Bo (having '28') would know immediately.\n",
    "If Ali was told June, she couldn't be sure Bo didn't know, because if the date was June 29, Bo (having '29') would know immediately.\n",
    "Therefore, Ali must have been told a month where all possible days also appear in other months. This eliminates April and June.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Remaining Possibilities (after Ali's first statement):\n",
    "\n",
    "- March: 18, 19\n",
    "- July: 16, 17, 19\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bo's Statement: \"At first I didn't know when Cam’s anniversary was, but I know now, after Ali's statement.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bo now knows the date. This means that after eliminating April and June, his day number must now point to only one possible date among the remaining options (March 18, 19; July 16, 17, 19).\n",
    "Let's check the day numbers in the remaining list:\n",
    "- 16: Only appears in July 16. If Bo had 16, he would know.\n",
    "- 17: Only appears in July 17. If Bo had 17, he would know.\n",
    "- 18: Only appears in March 18. If Bo had 18, he would know.\n",
    "- 19: Appears in March 19 and July 19. If Bo had 19, he would still not know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Bo now knows, his day number cannot be 19. This eliminates March 19 and July 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The Remaining Possibilities (after Bo's statement):\n",
    "\n",
    "- March: 18\n",
    "- July: 16, 17\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ali's Second Statement: \"Then I also know when Cam’s anniversary is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ali knows the month. She now knows the only possibilities are March 18, July 16, and July 17.\n",
    "For her to know the exact date, her month must only have one option left in this list.\n",
    "If her month was July, the options would be July 16 and July 17 – she wouldn't know.\n",
    "If her month was March, the only option is March 18 – she would know.\n",
    "Since Ali now knows, her month must be March.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The only remaining possibility that fits all the statements is March 18. Therefore, Cam's anniversary is March 18."

    "\n",
    "The \"Cheryl's Birthday\" problem is a well-known logic puzzle that can be solved using logical deduction. Let's first break down the problem before writing a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Cheryl gives Albert and Bernard a list of 10 possible birthdates, and tells them different information:\n",
    "- Albert knows the month.\n",
    "- Bernard knows the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheryl provides the following 10 possible dates:\n",
    "- May 15, May 16, May 19\n",
    "- June 17, June 18\n",
    "- July 14, July 16\n",
    "- August 14, August 15, August 17\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert then says: \"I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard replies: \"At first I didn’t know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert then says: \"Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Deduction\n",
    "1. From Albert's statement, we can deduce that Cheryl's birthday is not in May or June, because if it were, Bernard could possibly know the exact birthday if the day was unique (May 19 or June 18). Since Albert is sure Bernard doesn't know, we can eliminate May and June.\n",
    "2. After eliminating May and June, the remaining possible dates are:\n",
    "    - July 14, July 16\n",
    "    - August 14, August 15, August 17\n",
    "3. From Bernard’s statement, now knowing the birthday, we can deduce that Cheryl's birthday isn't on July 14 or August 14, because if it were, Bernard would still be uncertain (since both dates share the day 14).\n",
    "4. The remaining possible dates are:\n",
    "    - July 16\n",
    "    - August 15\n",
    "    - August 17\n",
    "5. Finally, from Albert’s statement, we deduce that Cheryl's birthday must be in July, because if it were in August, Albert wouldn’t be able to know the exact date. Thus, the birthday is July 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Program to Solve the Problem\n",
    "We can now write a Python program to generalize this solution and ensure it works for any list of possible dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- Step 1: The function groups the dates by month and by day.\n",
    "- Step 2: Based on Albert's statement, we eliminate the months of May and June.\n",
    "- Step 3: Based on Bernard's statement, we eliminate dates where the day appears more than once (i.e., both July 14 and August 14 are eliminated).\n",
    "- Step 4: Albert now knows Cheryl's birthday, so it must be in the month where only one date is left (i.e., July).\n",
    "- \n",
    "The program is designed to work with any given list of possible dates, not just the ones in the original problem."

    "Here's the program from **Gemini Pro 2.5** in 2025. It passes all the tests. However, there is a serious flaw: some of the explanatory output that is produces consists of static strings hard-coded to the original set of dates. The program still gets the right solution when given an alternative set of dates as input, but the explanatory output is wrong. (Also, I would have provided a keyword argument to make the printing optional.) I have to say that overall I like the style of [my program](Cheryl.ipynb) better, but this program certainly does the job (other than the issue with the explanatory output). Gemini's \"Show Thinking\" description of the program (not shown here) was also cogent, helpful, and correct."
